# Green Screen Replacement Script
The idea behind this project is to develop a script, which will replace uniform green background of a video with an image or another video

TODO:  
- :white_large_square: Find a film sample of a green/blue screen video  
- :white_large_square: Import the frames of the video  
- :white_large_square: Find the pixels that are approximately green/blue  
- :white_large_square: Set the opacity of those pixel to zero  
- :white_large_square: Add a different background  
- :white_large_square: Improvements?
  - :white_large_square: Removal of non-uniform, but constant over time background
  - :white_large_square: Blur background (like video calls)
  - :white_large_square: Real time computation
